# Shifted Maps – Are there networks in maps?

[Shifted Maps](https://shifted-maps.com) visualizes personal movement data as a network of map extracts showing visited places and their connections.

The geographic map dissolves and creates a flexible network layout, which reveals unique movement structures based on
geographic positions, travel time or travel frequency.

Shifted Maps is a student research project by [Lennart Hildebrandt](https://lennerd.com/) and [Heike Otten](http://www.heikeotten.de/) conducted at the [Urban Complexity Lab](https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/), [University of Applied Sciences Potsdam](https://www.fh-potsdam.de/).
